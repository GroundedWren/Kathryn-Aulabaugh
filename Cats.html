			<p>Born in 2016 and rescued by Kathryn in 2018, Avi is a completely black male cat with green eyes and a sweet but independent personality. He can usually be found curled up on Kathryn's lap, is very tolerant to being held, and loves getting into trouble with his little brother.</p>
			<p>He is also the uncontested staring contest / ominous looming champion who is not afraid to say hello to new people.</p>

			<p>Shadow, born in 2022 and rescued in 2023 by David with his half-sister Echo, is a warm-hearted black male cat with white patches on his chest and toes. Truly affection incarnate, Shadow craves human attention and is the cuddliest, floppiest little guy this side of the Mississippi.</p>
			<p>Known for his cute little squeaks, Shadow has boundless energy to chase his own tail and siblings all over the place.</p>

			<p>Don't let her sweet nature fool you, she's a fierce fighter in play-combat who can sound ten times her size and loves getting into trouble just as much as her brothers.</p>
